# Skillshare Course

This repo contains projects from the first ever course I did related to frontend web development (since deleted) from the website [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/). It is here I wrote my first lines of code and was introduced to many of the basic concepts in web development. Below I include screenshots to some of the different projects from this repo:
